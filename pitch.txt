* Little Stories

** Mission Statement

Little Stories is your child's online collaborative biography. It allows parents
and caregivers to tell the story for children too young to tell it themselves.

** Overview

Parents and caregivers upload content related to the child to
our secure servers.  Content includes things like:
- Photos
- Videos
- Diary Entries
- Sound Bytes
- Stories
- First moments

Little Stories uses the information to  build a chronological tale of the first few years of a
child's life. Parent's can view, print, and share media as well as
purchase gifts like calendars, photos, etc.

** How does it work for parents?

Parents sign up and provide pertinent information about their child
including birthdate, gender etc.  Little Stories will send periodic
emails around important milestones to remind parents to upload
content.  Using uploaded media little stories will create a timeline
of the first years of your childs life.

** How does it work for participating caregivers?

Caregivers enroll in the Little Stories system and commit to uploading
interesting media about the child.  It is believed that, like class
pictures, this content will be quite valuable.  As part of the service, caregivers
are reimbursed for the time the invest in the program.  In addition, an Ipad
application will be developed to make media uploading simple and easy.

All media uploaded by caregivers will be tagged with the names of the
children referenced.  If a child is referenced that is not in the
Little Stories program, or has a parent who has indicated that they do
not want their child shown in group photos, the media will be
immediately deleted.

** Security

Security is vitally important.  All communications are encrypted via bank standard SSL encryption.
Media is stored on encrypted volumes and is only accessible to parties
approved by the parent of the child.
