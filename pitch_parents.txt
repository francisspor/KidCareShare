* Little Stories

** Overview

Little Stories provides you access to special content about your
child's life at daycare.

** Overview

Participating caregivers enroll parents into the program.  During the
sign up process parents set their preferred security and media sharing
preferences.  Based on their settings, parents are provided with
content like:
- Weekly activity digests
- Quips/comments by and about the child
- Photos of activities and artwork
- Videos of plays
- Etc.

Some of the most interesting content about a child is their
interactions with other children.  In order to legally provide this
content parents must agree to allow other parents access to group
photos containing their child.  If a parent finds a particular photo
they would not like shared, they can flag it.

** Security

Security is vitally important.  All communications are encrypted via bank standard SSL encryption.
Media is stored on encrypted volumes and is only accessible to parties
approved by the parent of the child.
