* Little Stories

** Overview

Little Stories is a program for parents and caregivers that provides
participating parents with access to unique, previously
inaccessible content about their children.  In addition, Little
Stories is a fundraising program for caregivers.

** How does it work?

For participating caregivers, the Little Stories is an ongoing 
fundraising program.  Caregiviers enroll in the Little Stories system
and advertise the content as an additional service offering to parents.  A
percentage of each parents membership fee is passed back to the
caregiver.  To simplify the process of capturing content and managing
security issues, Little Stories provides an Ipad application specifically targeted at
caregivers to make providing content simple and easy.  

The caregiver is responsible for capturing individual and group
content for participating parents.  Content may includes things like:
* Weekly activity digests
* Quips/comments by and about the child
* Photos of activities and artwork
* Videos of plays
* Etc.

All content uploaded by caregivers will be tagged with the names of the
children referenced.  Media is secured based on the settings provided
by the childs parents.  If a child is referenced that is not in the
Little Stories program media will be deleted. 

Individual content pieces can be shared based on the security settings
dictated by the parents of the children included in the content item.

** Security

Security is vitally important.  All communications are encrypted via bank standard SSL encryption.
Media is stored on encrypted volumes and is only accessible to parties
approved by the parent of the child.
